Installation Instructions

1) Prerequisites

a) required
- A reasonably standard compliant Fortran 95 compiler. 
- GNU Make
- perl 5.x
- a Unix-like environment (bourne shell, rm command)

b) optional
- Doxygen 1.8.x (for re-generating the manual)
- Fortran 2003 or 2008 compliant compiler (use -D_F2003)
- MPI-1 library (OpenMPI is recommended)

2) Compilation
a) Out-of-source compilation
  The build system is set up to allow compiling the code
  in a directory different from where the sources are. 
  This has the benefit that multiple variants (different
  compiler flags settings, debuggind enabled/disabled,
  MPI enabled/disabled, or OpenMP enabled/disabled) can
  be compiled from the same sources at the same time. 
  
  - create a directory at the top level called
   build-<my-config> (where <my-config> can be 
   any text and change into this directory
  - create a copy or symbolic link from one of
   the configuration templates in the config directory
   under the name Makefile
  - adjust the compiler settings as needed
  - compile with: make
   this should automatically create dependencies,
   the version header file and then the executable.

  you can repeat the process for multiple configurations
  and use the mkall.sh script to recompile all of them
  from scratch in one go.

b) In-source compilation
  Skip the first step from above and symlink or copy
  the Makefile into the source directory.

  - document testing
