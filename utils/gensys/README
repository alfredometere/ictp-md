MD initial system configuration tool. It can currently generate
linearly  displaced homoatomic systems.  The amount of atoms is
calculated in function of the atomic radius for the atomic type
chosen.

The program is structured to be expanded easily  through adding
the new functionalities as subroutines.

The atomic radii and other details of  interest are read from a
plain text formatted data file called 'atoms.dat'. In this file
you can append new atomic types easily. The data file MUST STAY
IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE BINARY.

The columns in the data file are respectively:
1 - Atomic Number
2 - Element name
3 - Atomic radius in Angstrom
4 - Atomic mass in a.m.u.

To  add elements to  the data file,  just follow the example in
the data file, where  the last two  rows report two hard sphere
models.

The atomic radii  reported are Van der  Waals radii,  while for
certain metals, the metallic bond radius has been inserted.
