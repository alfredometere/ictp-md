ICTP-MD
=======

A simple modular MPI+OpenMP classical MD engine written in Fortran 95
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code in this  project is primarily targeted to be used as a teaching
tool for classes  and workshops  on software  development for scientific
high-performance computing  applications.  It is supposed to demonstrate
important  concepts  and allow  practicing  to work  on a  collaborative
project,  without  having  to  learn  an overly  complex  and  elaborate
infrastructure, as would  be needed  when working on a real life project
which aims for absolute best performance and scaling. Here preference is
given to simplicity and maintainability.
