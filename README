=======

A simple MPI/OpenMP parallel classical MD engine written in Fortran
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code in this project is primarily targeted to be used as a teaching
tool for  classes and workshops on  software  development for scientific
high-performance computing  applications.  It is supposed to demonstrate
important concepts   and allow practicing   to work  on a  collaborative
project,  without  having to  learn    an overly complex  and  elaborate
infrastructure,  as would be  needed  for absolute best performance  and
scaline. Simplicity and maintainability are preferred.
